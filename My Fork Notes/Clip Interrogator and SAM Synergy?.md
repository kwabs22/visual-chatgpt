# Where do they intersect?

CLIP Interrogator uses OpenCLIP which supports many different pretrained CLIP models. For the best prompts for Stable Diffusion 1.X use ViT-L-14/openai for clip_model_name. For Stable Diffusion 2.0 use ViT-H-14/laion2b_s32b_b79k

# Therefore the SAM model and the Clip interrogator use the ViT-L and H models but SAM has a custom one

# So if you figure out how CLIP Interrogator uses ViT can it use the SAM version as well?
